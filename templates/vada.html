                <ol>
                    <li> Wash and soak dal in about 3 cups of water for about 2-3 hours.</li>
                    <li> Drain all the water from soaked dal. Grind urad dal and channa dal together to smooth paste using very little water. </li>
                    <li> The batter should be thick and use very little water. Consistency is very important or otherwise, you will not be able to get the vada shape.</li>
                    <li> Add coriander, green chilli, ginger and chopped dry coconut to the batter. Mix it very well.</li>
                    <li> Add 2-3 tsp of rice flour to make it crispy.</li>
                    <li> Add pinch of hing to make it more digestible.</li>
                    <li> Heat the oil in a frying pan in medium flame. Wet your palms and take a lemon size batter.</li>
                    <li> Make hole in the center and slide it into the hot oil. The vada should float on top of oil.</li>
                    <li> Fry on both sides till it becomes golden brown in colour.</li>
                    <li> Serve medu vada immediately with chutney collections or sambar.</li>
